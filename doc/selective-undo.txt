INTRODUCTION					*selective-undo-introduction*

Selective undo is inspired by the Vim-section of Reddit, to have undo on a
visual selection, without touching the rest of the file. 
Keep in mind that the interace is still in beta status. There are plenty of
bugs, some limitations and bit quirkness.  

BUGS                            *selective-undo-bus*
1. As far we know, it will only operate on lines, not visual blocks. 
2. It dowsn know when you run out of undo stacks, so repeatedly pressing undo
can do weird things at the end of the stack.

In case if you found a bug, which is not stated above, feel free to report it on
the Github repository. 


==============================================================================
INSTALL						*selective-undo-install*

Install the distributed files into your Vim script directory which is usually
~/.vim/, or $HOME/vimfiles on Windows. You should consider to use one of the
famous package managers for Vim like vundle or neobundle to install the
plugin.

After installation you can run selective-undo directly.
